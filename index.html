            <p><h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3></p>
            <p><h5>Salvador Dalí was born on May 11, 1904, in Figueres, Spain. Dalí's father had a strict disciplinary approach to raise his children in contrast to   that of his mother, Felipa Domenech Ferres. She often indulged young Dalí in his art. At an early age, Dalí was producing highly sophisticated drawings, and was  strongly supported by his parents about his artistic talent. It was here that his parents built him an art studio before he entered art school. Upon recognizing his immense talent, Dalí's parents sent him to drawing school at the Colegio de Hermanos Maristas and the Instituto in Figueres, Spain, in 1916.After spending the first year at art school, he discovered modern painting in Cadaques whilst on vacationn with his family. There, he also met othe artists such as  Ramon Pichot. The following year, his father organized an exhibition of Dalí's charcoal drawings in the family home. By 1919, the young artist had his first public exhibition, at the Municipal Theatre of Figueres</h5></p>

            <p><h3><strong>School and surrealism</strong></h3></p>
            <p><h5>Between 1926 and 1929, Dalí made several trips to Paris, where he met with influential painters such as Picasso. In this period Dalí painted a number of works that displayed Picasso's influence. He also met Joan Miró and painter Magritte who introduced Dalí to Surrealism. By this time, Dalí was working with styles of Impressionism, Futurism and Cubism. Dalí's paintings became associated with three general themes: man's universe and sensations, sexual symbolism and ideographic imagery. In 1929, Dalí expanded his artistic exploration into the world of film-making when he collaborated with Luis Buñuel on two films, Un Chien andalou and L'Age d'or. Dalí's art appeared several years later in another film, Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound. This took place in 1945

            <p><h3><strong>The Dalí Theatre-Museum</strong></h3></p>
            <p><h5>Over the next 15 years, Dalí painted a series of 19 large canvases that included scientific, historical or religious themes. He often called this period "Nuclear Mysticism." From 1960 to 1974, Dalí dedicated much of his time to creating the Teatro-Museo Dalí (Dalí Theatre-Museum) in Figueres.The Teatro-Museo Dalí officially opened in 1974. The new building was formed from the ruins of the old and based on one of Dalí's designs, and is seen as the world's largest Surrealist structure.</h5></p>

            <p><h3><strong></strong>Final years</h3></strong></p>
            <p><h5>In 1980, Dalí was forced to retire from painting due to a motor disorder that caused permanent trembling and weakness in his hands. In 1984, Dalí was severely burned in a fire. Due to his injuries, he was confined to wheelchair. Friends, patrons and fellow artists rescued him from the castle and returned him to Figueres. In November 1988, Dalí entered a hospital in Figueres with a failing heart and on January 23, 1989, in the city of his birth, Dalí died of heart failure at the age of 84. His funeral was held at the Teatro-Museo, where he was buried in a crypt.</h5></p>
